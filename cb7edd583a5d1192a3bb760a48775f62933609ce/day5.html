							<h3>Relational structure in human brains: from simple sequence to complex network</h3>
							<p>Despite having limitless access to knowledge during this information explosion era, we all acknowledge that big data is not knowledge. Indeed, the underlying relational structure that links fragmented data is the key to knowledge acquisition. Humans excel at reasoning and inferring hidden relationships from outside events, an essential index of intelligence, yet the cognitive and neural mechanisms remain elusive. In this talk, I will present my lab's recent works aiming to understand how abstract structure knowledge, from simple sequences to hierarchy and networks, is represented and learned in the human brain. Our findings support dissociated structure-content neural representations and the essential role of relational structure in mediating memory and learning. We also demonstrate that brief pre-learning of certain paths that capture core structures could facilitate knowledge network learning.</p>

							<h3>How does the brain discover (and use) structure in sound sequences – evidence from brain imaging in humans</h3>
							<p>Sensitivity to patterns is fundamental to sensory processing, in particular in the auditory system, and a major component of the influential ‘predictive coding’ theory of brain function.  Supported by growing experimental evidence, the ‘predictive coding’ framework suggests that perception is driven by a mechanism of inference, based on an internal model of the signal source.  Because of the inherently dynamic nature of sound, key attributes of acoustic sources, including identity, state, and meaning are conveyed as a pattern across time. The detection of patterns also allows the system to extrapolate from past experience to form predictions about the most likely nature of sounds to follow, facilitating effective interaction with our environment on multiple perceptually relevant time scales.   However, a key element of predictive coding theory - the process through which the brain acquires this model, and its neural underpinnings – remains poorly understood.  I will discuss recent brain imaging, pupillometry and behavioural work which focuses on this missing link. Together, these emerging results paint a picture of the brain as a regularity seeker, rapidly extracting and maintaining representations of acoustic structure on multiple time scales and even when these are not relevant to behaviour. A network of auditory cortical frontal and hippocampal sources is implicated in the course of extracting the regularity and maintaining a top down predictive model. The similarity in brain responses across different instantiations of predictability suggest that they may be reflecting general processes linked to predictive perception.</p>
